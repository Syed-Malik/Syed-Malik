## 🧠 About Me

I'm Syed Abdul Malik, a passionate and forward-thinking Mechanical Engineer currently pursuing my Master's in Automotive Engineering at the University of Windsor, with a strong focus on vehicle dynamics, automation, robotics, and thermal systems. My engineering philosophy is rooted in innovation, precision, and impact-driven problem-solving.

My career began at Dayananda Sagar University, where I built a strong foundation in mechanical design and 3D printing. Since then, I’ve expanded my expertise to include advanced manufacturing processes, quality assurance, materials testing, and computer-aided design (CAD). I have hands-on experience in sheet metal fabrication, 3D printing, robotic systems integration, and CMM-based quality inspections.

In addition to my academic work, I've successfully completed internships and roles where I led or contributed to:

Quality inspection of automotive components using CMM and vision systems

Fabrication and assembly of mechanical prototypes

Root cause analysis and process optimization using Six Sigma tools

3D printer design, slicing optimization, and part fabrication

Noise and vibration analysis (NVH) in hybrid vehicles

I’m also exploring how AI and automation can transform traditional manufacturing and automotive systems. My passion for vehicle performance has led me to analyze aerodynamics, tire modeling, and suspension systems, especially in high-performance environments like Formula 1.

What sets me apart is my ability to combine mechanical engineering principles with modern tools and interdisciplinary knowledge. Whether it’s building systems from scratch, refining production quality, or optimizing existing workflows, I’m committed to making a measurable difference.

I’m currently seeking opportunities in manufacturing engineering, production systems, or quality assurance roles where I can contribute meaningfully and grow as a professional.
