## About Me

I’m Syed Abdul Malik, a mechanical engineer currently pursuing my Master's in Automotive Engineering at the University of Windsor. My interests span across quality assurance, manufacturing systems, and 3D printing. With a solid foundation in mechanical design and practical experience in both academic and industrial settings, I enjoy solving real-world engineering problems and continuously building on my skills.

Over the years, I’ve worked on a variety of projects—from developing a functional 3D printer to analyzing hybrid vehicle thermodynamics and optimizing quality control processes in manufacturing. I’ve gained hands-on experience with sheet metal fabrication, inspection tools like CMMs, Six Sigma methodologies, and CAD tools such as SolidWorks and CATIA.

What motivates me is seeing how small improvements in design or process can lead to big gains in efficiency and reliability. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of engineering and automation, and how modern technologies like AI and robotics can reshape production and vehicle systems.

I'm now actively looking for roles in manufacturing, quality, or process engineering where I can bring value, learn from industry experts, and contribute to meaningful projects.
